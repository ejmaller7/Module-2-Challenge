                    <p>
                        I am a business finance major from the University of Texas at San Antonio with aspirations of becoming a business owner in my life. In order to accomplish this,
                        I need to widen my skillset by learning many different aspects about what it takes to actually run my own company. Full stack web development can provide a way for me
                        to be able to create and manage my own website. Along with this, basic and extensive knowledge of software engineering can provide a different career path I have always
                        been interested in exploring.
                    </p>

                        Beyond my professional life, there are many other goals in my life I wish to accomplish. For example, someday, I would love to be able to design and build my own home
                        for my future family. Along with personal goals, I also have interests such as guitar, golf, and gaming, or the three "G's". Guitar has always been a way I can express myself
                        without the use or need of words. Golf is single handedly one of the most frustrating, yet satisfying sports on the planet, but it is great to be outdoors and relaxing with
                        friends and family. Lastly, gaming, which needs no explanation.
